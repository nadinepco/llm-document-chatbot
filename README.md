# Chat with Multiple PDFs
This is a **Proof of Concept** of creating a chatbot that can answer questions based on the PDF files uploaded
## Current Features:
- Upload multiple PDF files and answer questions about them
- Remember the conversation

## Future Improvements
- Add support for other file types
- If the question is not related to any of the PDF files, create a response for it. e.g. "I don't know"
- Cite sources for the answers (from which document it was taken)

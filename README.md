# ðŸ“š Multi-Modal Conversational RAG Chatbot
## Introduction
This is a **Proof of Concept** of creating a Multi-Modal Conversational Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with the content through natural language queries. The chatbot can handle both text and voice inputs, making it versatile and user-friendly.

## Features:
- **Document Upload:** Users can upload multiple PDF files to the chatbot.
- **Question Answering:** The chatbot uses different language models to answer questions based on the uploaded documents.
- **Voice Interaction:** Users can interact with the chatbot using voice commands using Deepgram's speech recognition and synthesis.
- **Text-based Interaction:** Users can also interact with the chatbot using text-based input.
- **Remember the Conversation:** The chatbot maintains a history of the conversation for contextual understanding.
- **Model Selection:** Users can choose between different language models for the chatbot's responses. (llama3-8b-8192, mixtral-8x7b-32768, gpt-3.5-turbo-0125)
- **Fallback Response:** If the question is not related to the documents, the chatbot responds with "I don't know".

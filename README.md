# ðŸ“š Chat with Multiple PDFs using Streamlit, Langchain, and OpenAI
This is a **Proof of Concept** of creating a Conversational Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that can answer questions and have a conversation based on the PDF files uploaded

## Current Features:
- Upload multiple PDF files and answer questions about them
- Remember the conversation
- Select different models: llama3-8b-8192, mixtral-8x7b-32768, gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
- If the question is not related to the documents, respond "I don't know"
